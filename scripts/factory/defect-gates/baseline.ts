 * `git show BASE_REF:` and never the branch copy, so an agent cannot
 * whitelist its own breakage. It also avoids `git stash`, which is banned in
 * factory worktrees because refs/stash is shared across them.
 *
 * The ref is validated first, separately from the path. A bad BASE_REF
 * (typo, a deleted branch, a force-pushed-away sha) must throw here, not
 * read as "no baseline" — silently returning null for every changed file
 * would look exactly like a branch that only ever added new files.
 *
 * Returns null when the file does not exist at that (valid) ref — a file
 * the branch added. Its baseline contribution is then correctly empty. Any
 * other `git show` failure (isMissingPathFailure false) throws instead.
