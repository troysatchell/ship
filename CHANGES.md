# CHANGES

Every improvement made to Ship during the ShipShape sprint: what was added, how to run it, and
how to roll it back. Newest first. One entry per ticket; the ticket ID is the join key to Linear,
to `audit/AUDIT_REPORT.md`, and to the branch that carried it.

Assignment rule 8. `scripts/factory/gate.sh` fails any branch that does not add an entry here.

## TRO-244 — CI pipeline with source-code inventory

**What changed.** Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: typecheck, build, and unit tests for both
packages on every PR and every push to `main`, plus a source-code inventory job that emits a
per-SHA manifest (files and lines per package, dependency tree, licenses) as a retained artifact.

Web unit tests run with `continue-on-error` because 13 are known-failing (TEST-1 / TRO-223). The
real gate is the step after them, which compares failure *identities* against
`audit/factory/quarantine.json` and fails only on **new** breakage.

`pnpm lint` is deliberately **not** wired in: finding TS-6 (TRO-211) established there is no
ESLint config anywhere, so the script exits 0 having checked nothing. Adding it would make CI
advertise a quality gate that does not exist.

**How to run it.** Automatic on PR and push to `main`; `workflow_dispatch` for a manual run.
Locally, the same checks are `scripts/factory/gate.sh`.

**Rollback.** Delete `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Nothing else depends on it.

## Factory harness — ticket remediation infrastructure (no ticket: tooling)

> Exempt from this file's ticket-ID join-key rule. This is sprint tooling, not a fix for an audit
> finding, so it has no entry in `AUDIT_REPORT.md` and no Linear ticket to join to. Every *code*
> change below this line does carry its ID.


**What changed.** Added the machinery that drives audit findings to merged fixes:

- `scripts/factory/worktree.sh` — provisions an isolated worktree, a dedicated database, and
  per-ticket ports. Necessary because `api/src/test/setup.ts` TRUNCATEs 16 tables in the
  `beforeAll` of every api test file; agents sharing a database corrupt each other's runs.
- `scripts/factory/gate.sh` — the per-ticket eval: typecheck, build, unit tests vs the quarantine
  baseline, tests-not-weakened, regression-test-present, `CHANGES.md` entry, scope, CodeRabbit
  capture. Writes `.factory/gate-result.json`.
- `scripts/factory/lib/testdiff.mjs` — compares failure identities, not counts. Verified against a
  forged run where one test broke and one was fixed: totals unchanged at 13, gate correctly failed.
- `audit/factory/quarantine.json` — the 13 known-failing web tests, so agent regressions are
  distinguishable from pre-existing red.
- `.coderabbit.yaml` — review configuration with path instructions tied to Ship's conventions.
- `.claude/skills/ship-factory/` — orchestration, agent contract, eval tiers, escalation gates.

**How to run it.**

```bash
scripts/factory/worktree.sh TRO-178 fix/db-1-migration-runner
cd ../Ship-wt-tro_178 && source .factory-env
scripts/factory/gate.sh          # --fast for the inner loop
```

**Rollback.** Remove `scripts/factory/`, `audit/factory/`, `.coderabbit.yaml`, and
`.claude/skills/ship-factory/`. Clean up worktrees with `git worktree remove`, and drop the
per-ticket databases (`ship_wt_*`) from the `ship-audit-pg` container.

## TRO-243 — Secrets loading hard-failed on any host that is not AWS

**What changed.** `loadProductionSecrets()` fetched from AWS SSM with no error handling under
`NODE_ENV=production` and overwrote `DATABASE_URL`. Off AWS it threw and killed the process before
the database was ever contacted. It now falls back to environment secrets when they are present
and rethrows when they are not. AWS behaviour is unchanged.

**How to run it.** Set `DATABASE_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, and `CORS_ORIGIN` in the environment and
start with `NODE_ENV=production`.

**Rollback.** Revert the merge of `fix/ssm-fallback` (`5b72a79`).

---

## TRO-242 — Build the image from source and serve the SPA from the API

**What changed.** Multi-stage `Dockerfile` so the image builds from a clean checkout — the
previous one copied `shared/dist/` and `api/dist/`, both gitignored and untracked, so it only
worked in the build-locally-then-ship AWS flow. Express now serves `web/dist` after all `/api`
routes. Same-origin is required by `sameSite: 'strict'` session cookies and by the collaboration
WebSocket URL being derived from `window.location.host`.

**How to run it.** `docker build -t ship . && docker run -p 3000:3000 ship`, or deploy to Render,
which builds from the repository.

**Rollback.** Revert the merge of `feat/render-deploy` (`bace770`).
